1- The variables "num1" and "num2" are currently of the string data type, so the variable "result" performs string concatenation instead of numeric addition. However, it is not desirable for "result" to be of the string data type in this context.


2- My proposed solution to resolve the issue would involve converting the variables "num1" and "num2" from their current data type (which is likely strings) to numbers, prior to performing the addition operation. This would ensure that the operation adds the numerical values of the variables, rather than concatenating their string representations.
