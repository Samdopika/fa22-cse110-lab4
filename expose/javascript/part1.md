## Q1

For line 9, it's gonna print "values added: 20". That's because the 'add' parameter is true, so the code inside the 'if' block runs, adds the two numbers (10 and 10), and gives us 20 as the sum.

## Q2

As for line 13, it'll print "final result: 20". That line is outside the 'if' block, so it'll run no matter what 'add' is set to. It just prints "final result: " and the value of 'result', which is 20 in this case.

## Q3

for line 9, it's still gonna print "values added: 20" 'cause the 'add' is true and the code inside the 'if' block runs. It adds 10 and 10, getting 20, and then shows the message "values added: " with the value of 'result'.


## Q4

But for line 13, it's a different story. You'll get a ReferenceError here because the 'result' variable isn't defined at this point. That's because you used 'let' to declare 'result' inside the 'if' block, and 'let' has block scope. So, 'result' isn't accessible outside the 'if' block, and since line 7 is outside, it'll throw an error when trying to use 'result'.

## Q5

For line 9, you're gonna run into a TypeError. That's because you've declared 'result' with 'const', which means it's a constant and you can't change its value once it's set. But you're trying to change it on the next line with 'result = num1 + num2;', and that's a no-go since you can't reassign a constant variable.

## Q6

Now, about line 13 â€“ you won't even get there. The code stops running because of the error on line 4, so line 7 won't print anything or give an error. It's all because the code got stuck at the TypeError from trying to mess with a constant variable.
